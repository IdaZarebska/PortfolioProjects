# Portfolio Projects
This repository consists of folders for each of my data analysis projects. Every folder consists of both the raw data and the actual analysis in the tool of my choice. It also includes a dedicated README file with all the details regarding a project. The projects are as follows:

### Superstore Sales Project
Created in Excel, it includes a dashboard presenting year-by-year sales of a superstore.

### LEGO Project
Written in SQL, it analyses the use of LEGO parts, sets, minifigures, and themes.

### Horse-racing Project
Done with Python, it answers several questions regarding the Polish racehorses performance.
