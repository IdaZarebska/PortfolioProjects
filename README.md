# Portfolio Projects
This repository consists of folders for each of my data analysis projects. Every folder consists of both the raw data and the actual analysis in the tool of my choice. It also includes a dedicated README file with all the details regarding a project. The projects are as follows:

### Superstore Sales Project
Here, I built a fully dynamic dashboard regarding superstore sales using Excel. The data was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting?datasetId=835308&sortBy=voteCount). First, I cleaned the data by handling missing values; then, I created the dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers.

### Olympics Project
In this project, I built a fully dynamic dashboard in Tableau. I downloaded the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?datasetId=31029&sortBy=voteCount). The completion of the project required joining two tables, creating a calculated field, and applying a filter to several worksheets. The project can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlympicsDashboard_16794879136080/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### LEGO Project
In this projects, I answered some questions regarding the LEGO dataset, downloaded from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). I first created a PostgreSQL database with appropriate constraints and filled the tables with data. Then, I wrote queries to find answers for 10 questions; some of the questions came from the [LEGO competition](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/lego-sets-popularity) held by DataCamp; other were designed by myself. The queries used joins, subqueries, and common table expressions.

### Horse-racing Project
In this project, I explored Polish horse-racing data with Python. The data was scraped from [this site](https://koniewyscigowe.pl/statystyki_koni?rasa=xx&sezon=2017). The first task was to clean the data: remove unwanted characters, change data types and formatting, split one column into two, handle missing values. Next, I answered several questions concerning the distribution of the data, trends, and performance. Each answer is accompanied by an appropriate visualisation. The libraries used: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib.Pyplot, Seaborn.
