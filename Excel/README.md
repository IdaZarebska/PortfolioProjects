Here, I built a fully dynamic dashboard regarding superstore sales using Excel. The data was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting?datasetId=835308&sortBy=voteCount). First, I cleaned the data by handling missing values; then, I created the dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers.

The raw data, as well as the working data and the final dashboard, are included in the Excel file provided in this folder.

There were 6 rows with missing values in the Sales column. They have been dropped.
There were 11 rows with missing values in the Postal Code column. All of them were from Burlington, Vermont. The nulls have been replaced with the postal code for this city.

The questions answered by this dashboard are as follows:
1.	What are the sales per month?
2.	What is the most popular ship mode?
3.	What are the sales per region?
4.	What are the sales by city?

The dashboard can be filtered based on the Segment, Category, and Years columns, giving a full overview over the performance of the store.
