In this projects, I answered some questions regarding the LEGO dataset, downloaded from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). I first created a PostgreSQL database with appropriate constraints and filled the tables with data. Then, I wrote queries to find answers for 10 questions; the first five questions came from the [LEGO competition](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/lego-sets-popularity) held by DataCamp; other were designed by myself. The queries used joins, subqueries, and common table expressions.

This folder contains the raw data, the code needed to create the tables, and the analysis itself.

The questions answered are as follows:
1. What is the average number of LEGO sets released per year?
2. What is the average number of LEGO parts per year?
3. What are the 5 most popular colours used in LEGO parts?
4. What proportion of LEGO parts are transparent?
5. What are the most popular and the rarest LEGO bricks?
6. What are the most popular and the rarest categories of parts?
7. What are the most popular and the rarest minifigures?
8. What themes were discontinued after a year?
9. What is the most popular theme?
10. What theme has been around for the longest period of time?

Some of the questions are further explored with additional queries.
