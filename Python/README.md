In this project, I explored Polish horse-racing data with Python. The data was scraped from [this site](https://koniewyscigowe.pl/statystyki_koni?rasa=xx&sezon=2017). The first task was to clean the data: remove unwanted characters, change data types and formatting, split one column into two, handle missing values. Next, I answered several questions concerning the distribution of the data, trends, and performance. Each answer is accompanied by an appropriate visualisation. The libraries used: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib.Pyplot, Seaborn.

This folder provides the Jupyter Notebook with the data cleaning and analysis code, as well as a CSV file with the raw data.

The questions answered in this project are as follows:
1. What is the distribution of races during the year?
2. What are the ranges of wins for every place? How does this change based on the race category?
3. What is the distribution of places taken by different jockeys?
4. What jockey categories participate in various types of races?
5. Who is the most successfull coach?
6. Which jockey accumulated the highest prize?
